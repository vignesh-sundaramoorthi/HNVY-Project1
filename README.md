# HNVY-Project1

Our project is about finding relationships between Covid-19 infection rates and death rates with different factors (Vaccination, Testing, GDP and Policies)

This is the instruction of checking our group's project, first of all, please do a git pull of our project and do the following:

1. Open the [api_keys.py](https://github.com/vignesh-sundaramoorthi/HNVY-Project1/blob/main/api_keys.py) file to insert your Google API key.
2. Open the [Map_API_part.ipynb](https://github.com/vignesh-sundaramoorthi/HNVY-Project1/blob/main/Map_API_part.ipynb) and run the notebook to check the latest confirmed cases of Covid-19 over the world from the dataset.
3. Open the [Vaccine_Part.ipynb](https://github.com/vignesh-sundaramoorthi/HNVY-Project1/blob/main/Vaccine_Part.ipynb) and run the note book to check whether vaccination have a positive effect on lowering the increasing rate    of Covid-19 cases and deaths or not.  
   (Optional: if you want to have a look of all the figures only from the above steps, please check the [Outputs_YY](https://github.com/vignesh-sundaramoorthi/HNVY-Project1/tree/main/Outputs_YY) folder)
4. Open the [totaltests_vs_totalcases.ipynb](https://github.com/vignesh-sundaramoorthi/HNVY-Project1/blob/main/totaltests_vs_totalcases.ipynb) and run the note book to obtain the relationship between number of tests conducted and the      confirmed COVID-19 cases for different countries.  
   (Optional: if you want to have a look of the figure only from the above step, please check the [Outputs_HL](https://github.com/vignesh-sundaramoorthi/HNVY-Project1/tree/main/Outputs_HL) folder)
5. Open the [GDP_vs_Mortality.ipynb](https://github.com/vignesh-sundaramoorthi/HNVY-Project1/blob/main/GDP_vs_Mortality.ipynb) and run the note book to obtain the relationship between GDP and Total deaths per million for different countries/GDP groups. The output of the scatter plot and the regression analysis can be found in Outputs_VS(https://github.com/vignesh-sundaramoorthi/HNVY-Project1/tree/main/Outputs_VS).
